## Heat Content's Effects on Bivalve Larvae Abundance

Ari Paulik  
OCEAN 215 Final Project  
Autumn 2024  

I had two research questions/hypotheses for this project: 1. Does oceanic heat content vary with time and 2. Do heat content and bivalve larvae abundance hold a relationship in the research area? My goals for this project were to compare these two variables in the most effecient but informative way possible. I wanted my results to be clear and to be able to end my project with a definitive statement about how these variables are connected. After cleaning, processing, and analyzing my data, I discovered that there is a positive, statistically significance relationship between time and oceanic heat content but no significant relationnship between bivalve larvae abundance and time or heat content.
